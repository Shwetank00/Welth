Prisma helps to write SQL code easily 
we are using supabase for postgresql database 
arject for protection
using clerk for user authentication

using supabase as database it is a postgre sql database we are using moe generic (prisma) instead of supabase internal framework so that if we want to switch from supabase we can easily

using arcjet for security--> bot detection rate limiting email validation

using inngest for recalculating reccuring transactions, monthly financial report, budget alerts using AI

using nextjs for frontend and backend

npx prisma migrate dev --name create-models-->is to push the prisma table

using prisma writes the sql code by itself so it makes our work easy

npm i @prisma/client
npx inngest-cli@latest dev

react-spinners gives us a few loaders

npm i react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
manage forms and zod validate them

npm i @clerk/nextjs

npm run email

react email for email template

resend for sending emails
